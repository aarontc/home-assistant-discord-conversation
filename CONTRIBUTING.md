# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This project uses [Dagger](https://dagger.io/)
to pin the exact CI environment, so the commands you run locally are the same
ones GitLab CI runs.

## Prerequisites

You only need **Dagger** on your `PATH`. Dagger spins up a Python 3.14
container, installs `uv`, and runs everything inside it — so you don't need
Python, `uv`, `ruff`, or `pytest` installed on your host.

- Dagger: `v0.20.5` (see `.tool-versions`)
  - Install: <https://docs.dagger.io/install> or `mise install` if you use mise
- Docker (or another OCI runtime) must be running for Dagger to spin up containers

## Running the full check suite

Run the same pipeline CI runs on merge requests:

```sh
dagger call all
```

That runs lint, the pytest suite, and the versioning-helper tests
concurrently and fails on the first error. Please run it before every commit.

## Running individual checks

| Task                       | Command                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Lint (ruff check + format) | `dagger call lint`            |
| Tests                      | `dagger call test`            |
| Tests against latest HA    | `dagger call test-latest`     |
| Versioning-helper tests    | `dagger call test-versioning` |

The first run of each pulls the Python image; subsequent runs reuse the cached
`uv` volume and are much faster.

If you don't have Docker handy, the host-side equivalent of the lint+test
gate is:

```sh
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run pytest
```

## Git hooks

Two hooks live in `hooks/`:

- `pre-commit` runs `dagger call lint` and aborts the commit on failure.
- `commit-msg` enforces that the commit subject starts with `(Major)`,
  `(Minor)`, or `(Patch)` — the markers the auto-versioning pipeline reads
  (see [Versioning](#versioning)). Merge/fixup/squash/revert subjects are
  exempt.

Enable both **once per clone** by pointing Git at the in-repo hooks
directory:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

To skip the hooks for one commit (discouraged), pass `--no-verify`.

## Versioning

Releases use semantic versioning and are driven entirely by commit
messages. Every commit subject must start with one of these markers
(enforced by the `commit-msg` hook):

| Marker    | Effect            | Example                                       |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `(Major)` | `X.y.z → X+1.0.0` | `(Major) drop support for HA before 2026.6`   |
| `(Minor)` | `x.Y.z → x.Y+1.0` | `(Minor) config_flow: per-guild channel list` |
| `(Patch)` | `x.y.Z → x.y.Z+1` | `(Patch) bot: ignore webhook messages`        |

Keep the subject under ~72 chars. An optional area prefix (`bot:`,
`config_flow:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, …) may follow the severity marker. The
highest marker across all commits since the last tag wins.

Avoid the literal string `skip ci` (or `ci skip`) anywhere in the subject or
body — GitLab matches those markers to suppress the pipeline, and `tag:auto`
won't run.

### Previewing the next release

```sh
dagger call commits-since-tag   # list commits and the severity each contributes
dagger call next-version        # print the version the next release would get
```

### Cutting a release

Releases are tagged automatically by CI. The `tag:auto` GitLab CI job runs on
every push to `main`, calculates the next version from commit subjects, and
creates the tag via the GitLab API.

For this to work, a **project CI/CD variable `PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN`** must be
set to a Project Access Token (or Personal Access Token) that has the
**`api`** scope — it reads the version files and writes the bump commit + tag
through the REST API, for which `write_repository` alone is insufficient. Create
it under **Settings → Access Tokens** and mark the variable **Masked** and
**Protected**.

The job is a no-op on pipelines triggered by tags themselves, so there's no
feedback loop.

### Tagging manually

You can also invoke the same Dagger function locally — useful for testing or
to tag from a detached branch:

```sh
export GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-…
dagger call create-tag \
    --source=. \
    --gitlab-url=https://gitlab.idleengineers.com \
    --project-id=aaron/home-assistant-discord-conversation \
    --token=env:GITLAB_TOKEN
```

### Publishing GitHub releases

GitHub is a push mirror of this GitLab project. The
`.github/workflows/release.yaml` workflow ("Publish GitHub releases") turns
each `vX.Y.Z` tag into a GitHub Release, building the notes from the
`(Major)/(Minor)/(Patch)` commit subjects in that tag's range. HACS reads
these releases to detect new versions. It runs on three triggers:

- **`push` of a `v*` tag** (normal path) — the mirror pushes new tags to
  GitHub, and that push fires the workflow, so the release lands within the
  mirror's sync window (~1-5 min).
- **`schedule`** (twice a day) — a safety net that publishes any tag still
  missing a release.
- **`workflow_dispatch`** — manual run; pass a `tag` (and `replace: true`) to
  (re)publish a specific release.

The publish step is idempotent (existing releases are skipped) and the job is
serialized via a `concurrency` group, so the overlapping triggers never
double-publish.

The mirror must authenticate over **SSH** (deploy key). An HTTPS personal
access token would need the `workflow` scope just to push changes under
`.github/workflows/`, and tag pushes made with such a token may not reliably
trigger Actions; SSH avoids both problems.
